            You should read this policy in full, but here&#39;s a very brief
            summary with the key points we hope you take away from it:
          </p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              We don&#39;t sell your personal data to anyone. Never have, never
              will.
            </li>
            <li>
              All we know about you is what you share by visiting and exploring
              our website. We don&#39;t collect any of your personal information
              from any third parties, so it&#39;s completely up to you to decide
              what you want to share. You can use our website under a pseudonym,
              for instance.
            </li>
            <li>
              When you use our website, even if you aren&#39;t logged in, we
              receive some personal information from you like the type of device
              you&#39;re using and your IP address. You can choose to share
              additional information with us by creating an account. We use this
              information for improving our services and for keeping our website
              functional and secure.

            <li>
              You are free to opt in and out of our newsletters, update your

              ask us to give you a copy of the information you&#39;ve submitted,
              by contacting us via email: contact@iqbenchmark.com
            </li>
            <li>
              We use your answers to our surveys, tests, and other tools to
              determine what content is relevant to you and to improve our
              understanding of personality traits. You&#39;re completely free to
              decide which surveys to take and which tools to explore.

            <strong>1. How Do We Collect Information?</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            First, we collect, store, and use information you share on our
            website. This includes your e-mail address, comments, messages sent
            to other members, and any other information you choose to enter on
            the website.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you post personal information of another person on our website,
            you must make sure you have that person&#39;s consent to both the
            disclosure and the processing of their personal data in accordance
            with this privacy policy. That&#39;s your responsibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            Second, if you purchase something for yourself or for anyone else on
            our website, we&#39;ll collect payment and tax information (e.g.,
            country of residence), contact and delivery information (e.g.,
            e-mail address), and details of what you bought.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally, we record certain technical information whenever you use
            our website. This includes information about your device and about
            your visits to and use of our website, such as your IP address,
            browser type and version, page views, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            We also use cookies (small encrypted data files stored and sent by
            your browser whenever you visit our website) to store and retrieve
            your login status, personality test results, and various website
            settings. Some of the cookies are account-specific while others are
            not. For more information about cookies, please see the following

            <strong>2. How Do We Use the Information We Collect?</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            We use the information we collect to provide you with our services
            as well as content that&#39;s relevant and personal to you.
            Consequently, it&#39;s necessary for us to use your information to:
          </p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              send you your personality test results, if you request them in the
              results screen or in the Preferences section;
            </li>
            <li>
              send you account-related messages, such as password recovery
              e-mails;
            </li>
            <li>
              identify you and ensure the security of your account – e.g., by
              verifying that you own the e-mail address linked to your account;
            </li>
            <li>
              collect payments from you and send you e-mails with your order
              details, if you decide to purchase something from us;
            </li>
            <li>
              provide you with content and services relevant to you – e.g.,
              information for people with your personality type;
            </li>
            <li>
              help you connect with other members – e.g., by creating a friend
              request automatically if someone tries to send you an e-mail
              invite;
            </li>
            <li>
              respond to your questions or complaints, or to complaints made
              about your use of our website.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We have a legitimate interest in using your information in these
            ways. It&#39;s necessary for us to do that to make our services and
            content as relevant to you as possible, and that&#39;s in both of
            our interests.
          </p>
          <p>
            In addition, we have a legitimate interest in maintaining our
            relationship with you, improving our website and services, and
            protecting both you and other users.
          </p>
          <p>Consequently, we use your information to:</p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              conduct analytics on how you use our website in order to better
              understand your needs and to optimize our service and experience.
              For instance, by measuring the time you spend on a certain page
              before and after a design change, we can understand whether
              there&#39;s anything we need to tweak. In order to do that, we use
              third party services, Google Analytics and Hotjar, to collect
              standard internet log information and details of visitor behaviour
              patterns (for example, how much time you spent reading your
              personality test results). If we have an existing customer
              relationship with you, we may also use Facebook Pixel to analyze
              the effectiveness of our Facebook ads. We&#39;ve already mentioned
              these services in the Cookies section above.
              <br />
              <em>
                This information is only processed in a way which does not
                identify anyone. For example, we don&#39;t make, and don&#39;t
                allow Google to make, any attempt to match such information with
                personal data we hold about you.
              </em>
            </li>
            <li>
              improve our website and develop new functionality. For example, if
              the majority of respondents in one of our surveys say they&#39;d
              like to learn more about dealing with a difficult colleague,
              we&#39;ll certainly take that into account.
            </li>
            <li>
              conduct internal analysis and scientific / statistical research to
              improve our services and understanding of personality traits. For
              instance, your responses to our surveys could help us figure out
              whether Extraverts or Introverts are more likely to be early
              risers. The raw research data you supply is anonymized or
              pseudonymized, and access to it is strictly limited. Even our own
              researchers only see data that cannot be connected back to any
              individually identifying information, and we only publish
              aggregate statistical data.
            </li>
            <li>
              keep the website secure and prevent fraud – e.g., by logging
              authentication attempts or activities related to your account;
            </li>
            <li>
              keep both you and other users safe, including working with law
              enforcement where necessary. For instance, we may inform the
              police if something you&#39;ve posted makes us believe that
              it&#39;s highly likely you or someone else is in immediate
              physical danger.
            </li>
            <li>
              verify compliance with the terms and conditions governing the use
              of the website, e.g. by reviewing your private messages if another
              user complains of harassment.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            While our legitimate interests cover a lot of what we do, in the
            following circumstances other legal grounds apply to how we process
            your personal data:
          </p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              where we expressly require consent from you for the processing in
              question;
            </li>
            <li>
              where we provide services to you as a member – in which case
              we&#39;ll have a contract with you for this and we&#39;ll process
              your data in accordance with our contract with you (see our Terms
              and Conditions). In particular, our contract allows us to retain
              and delete data in ways which override certain rights you may
              otherwise have had if we were relying on consent or our legitimate
              interests for the data processing in question.
            </li>
            <li>
              where another legal ground applies (which will be rare) – e.g., to
              protect your or another person&#39;s vital interests, or where
              we&#39;re required to process the information by law.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            Finally, in addition to what we discussed above, we&#39;ll only use
            your information with your consent:
          </p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              to send you e-mail newsletters, if you&#39;ve specifically agreed
              to receive them and confirmed that by clicking a link in the
              verification e-mail. You can unsubscribe from our newsletters at
              any time by clicking a link at the bottom of any message.
            </li>
            <li>
              where the assessment for which you&#39;re supplying us with
              personal data relates to “special category” personal data (e.g.,
              your religious beliefs or political views), and which we then
              process to provide assessment results and then subsequently for
              research purposes (where the data will be anonymized or
              pseudonymized). Here we rely first on our legitimate interests,
              and second on your explicit consent to this.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>Please note you may withdraw your consent at any time.</p>
          <p>
            Where you supply us with special category personal data we may also
            further process this data for research purposes – typically it will
            be anonymized so that it ceases to be personal data. In this case
            we&#39;ll also rely on Article 9.2(j) of the General Data Protection
            Regulation (GDPR) to the extent the processing of personal data is
            involved.
          </p>
          <p>
            We won&#39;t provide your personal information to any third parties
            for the purpose of direct marketing by those parties.
          </p>
          <h2>
            <strong>3. Do We Transfer Your Information Elsewhere?</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            As a worldwide digital service, we need to work with a number of
            providers, some of which are located outside the UK and the European
            Economic Area (EEA), e.g. in the U.S., in order to be able to
            operate our website and to make our services available online. Some
            of our staff also operate outside the EEA. Consequently, some of
            your personal data may be transferred outside the EEA. Some of the
            countries in question may not have data protection laws equivalent
            to those in force in the EEA.
          </p>
          <p>
            We&#39;ll ensure that any transfer of your personal information
            outside the EEA where the GDPR applies to such transfer will be
            subject to the appropriate or suitable relevant safeguards (e.g.
            European Commission approved contract), as permitted under the GDPR,
            with those measures designed to help safeguard your privacy rights
            and give you remedies in the unlikely event of a misuse of your
            personal information.
          </p>
          <p>
            In general, we use contract clauses for such transfers (as per the
            Article 46.2 of the GDPR), unless the country in question is judged
            adequate under the Article 45 of the GDPR (including in the case of
            the U.S., Privacy Shield). We also limit access to your personal
            information to those members of our staff who have a business reason
            for knowing such information. If you&#39;d like further information
            on this, please contact us.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here&#39;s a list of third party providers we&#39;ll share your

              We&#39;ve listed all our third party providers here to be as
              transparent as possible. In practice, “sharing” is a very generous
              term when it comes to us transferring your information outside our
              company. We always transfer as little data as we can, also
              encrypting it where possible. For instance, our e-mail service
              provider would need to know your e-mail address to deliver a
              password recovery link, but we won&#39;t tell them your age.

            <strong>4. How Can You Manage Your Information?</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            If you have an account on our website, you can use the psection to
            change most of your personal details. For instance, it allows you
            to:
          </p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>update your e-mail address;</li>
            <li>edit your profile name or make it private;</li>
            <li>manage instant notifications;</li>
            <li>delete your profile.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            If you delete your profile, we&#39;ll anonymize your user record,
            removing your e-mail address, name, age, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            We won&#39;t, however, delete your posts in Discussions, messages
            you sent to other members, your responses to our tests and surveys,
            log records, and other similar data. We need to keep that data for a
            number of reasons, such as protecting other users&#39; right of
            freedom of expression, preserving the integrity of our research, or
            ensuring the security of our website, and the retention of this data
            is necessary for us to provide our services to you and others.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              If you decide to delete your profile, please make sure you first
              save any information you&#39;d like to keep. Once the profile is
              gone, it&#39;s gone – for instance, if you then realize that you
              haven&#39;t saved that amazing poem another member sent you,
              we&#39;ll have no way of recovering your account.
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            You can also ask us to correct any personal data you have provided
            to us, or to remove specific personally identifying information from
            our website. E.g., if you accidentally post your e-mail address in
            Discussions and ask us to remove it, we&#39;ll do that.
          </p>
          <p>
            We&#39;ll need to verify the authenticity of any data correction or
            removal request – so please make sure your account is always linked
            to an active e-mail address. We don&#39;t ask you for data such as
            your full name, address, or date of birth – your e-mail address is
            the only real identifier – so if you lose access to the address
            linked to your account, we&#39;ll have no way of verifying you own
            the account.

            <strong>5. How and When Do We Share Your Information?</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            To begin with, anyone can see your public profile, which shows
            information such as your name and personality test results. You can
            see what your public profile page looks like by following the link
            in the Overview section of the profile page, and you can also make
            your profile private in the Preferences section.
          </p>
          <p>
            If you post content in our Discussions, comment sections,
            translation area, or anywhere else on our website where that&#39;s
            possible, you should assume that anyone will be able to read that
            information – unless it&#39;s clear that access to such information
            will be limited to yourself or a specific user (e.g., your private
            messages or notes in the Premium Profile). Depending on the section,
            other members may also see your name, gender, personality test
            results, and participation history (e.g., your previous posts).
          </p>
          <p>
            Our staff, agents, suppliers, and subcontractors may also need to
            have access to your information where that&#39;s necessary. This
            applies to any member of our group of companies – e.g., our
            subsidiaries and our ultimate holding company and all its
            subsidiaries.
          </p>
          <p>
            <em>
              For example, if you ask us to fix a misbehaving subscription,
              someone from our team will need to access your account to do that.
              However, access to your personal data is strictly limited and
              monitored, with sensitive details (such as your password) securely
              encrypted.
            </em>
          </p>
          <p>
            Besides that, there are also certain other circumstances where we
            may disclose your personal information:
          </p>
          <ul role="list">
            <li>
              where we&#39;re required to do so by law or in connection with any
              ongoing, prospective, or reasonably likely (in our opinion) legal
              proceedings;
            </li>
            <li>
              where we need to establish, exercise, or defend our legal rights
              (e.g., providing information to others for the purposes of fraud
              prevention);
            </li>
            <li>
              if we&#39;re engaged in a merger, reorganisation, or any similar
              proceeding requiring the transfer of your information – we&#39;d
              then share your information with a party involved in such a
              process (for example, a potential purchaser);
            </li>
            <li>
              if we have strong reason to believe that you or someone else is in
              immediate physical danger (e.g., there&#39;s a reasonably credible
              threat of self-harm posted in our Discussions), we&#39;ll try to
              get in touch with local authorities and provide them with
              information that may help them prevent that.
            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We don&#39;t serve ads on our website, and we don&#39;t share your
            data with online advertisers. As a general rule, except as discussed
            above, we don&#39;t share your personal information with any third

            services to you and to fulfil the purposes described in this policy
            or as otherwise described in our Terms and Conditions. This also
            applies to any other parties that we share your information with.
          </p>
          <p>
            Here are some examples of categories of data along with their

            <li>activity logs, minus the above – 1 year;</li>
            <li>
              transient activity records, such as e-mail invites or password
              reset requests – 3 months;

              <br />
              <em>
                We&#39;ll regularly delete accounts that aren&#39;t linked to
                any meaningful activity and have been inactive for more than two
                years.
              </em>
            </li>
            <li>

            </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            We&#39;ll depersonalize your information or remove it entirely from
            our systems once we no longer need it to comply with our legal or
            regulatory obligations, or for other purposes described in this
            policy.

            <strong>7. How Do We Handle Children&#39;s Information?</strong>
          </h2>
          <p>
            You may only use our website if you&#39;re over the age at which you
            can provide consent to data processing under the laws of your
            country. Regardless of local laws, children under 13 aren&#39;t
            allowed to use our website. If you&#39;re a parent and you learn
            that your child is using our website, and you don&#39;t want them
            to, please get in touch with us.
          </p>
          <p>
            As a small company, we don&#39;t have the resources to verify and
            track parental consent – so unfortunately, if you&#39;re below the
            age at which you can provide consent in your country, you aren&#39;t
            entitled to use our website.

            We take reasonable technical and organisational precautions to

            Still, we can&#39;t guarantee complete security of data sent over
